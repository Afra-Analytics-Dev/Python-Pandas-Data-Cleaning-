# üçΩÔ∏è Online Food Preference Analysis

## üìñ Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of an online food preferences dataset containing customer demographic information and their food ordering behavior. The dataset captures various factors influencing customers' decisions to order food online, including age, gender, income, occupation, and geographical location.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset contains **388 records** with **13 features** capturing customer demographics and food ordering behavior:

### üîç Features:
- **Demographic Information:**
  - `Age`: Customer's age
  - `Gender`: Male/Female/Prefer not to say
  - `Marital Status`: Single/Married/Prefer not to say
  - `Occupation`: Student/Employee/Self Employeed/House wife
  - `Monthly Income`: Income brackets (No Income to More than 50000)
  - `Educational Qualifications`: School to Ph.D levels
  - `Family size`: Number of family members

- **Geographical Data:**
  - `latitude`, `longitude`: Geographical coordinates
  - `Pin code`: Area pin codes (5600xx series - Bangalore, India)

- **Behavioral Data:**
  - `Output`: Whether the customer orders food online (Yes/No)
  - `Feedback`: Customer feedback (Positive/Negative)

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of customer demographics and preferences
2. **Identify key factors** influencing online food ordering decisions
3. **Analyze geographical patterns** in food ordering behavior
4. **Understand customer feedback** and satisfaction levels
5. **Build predictive models** for customer behavior prediction

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
