# Python-Pandas-Data-Cleaning-
**Netflix Data Analysis & Cleaning Project**

# Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data cleaning and preliminary analysis of a Netflix movies and TV shows dataset. The original dataset, netflix1.csv, was processed using Python and the Pandas library in a Jupyter Notebook to ensure data quality, consistency, and readiness for further analysis or visualization.
The cleaned dataset is exported into both CSV and Excel formats for easy access and use in other tools like Tableau, Power BI, or for building machine learning models.

# Dataset
The dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix up to a certain date, including details like:
i. Show Information: Title, Type (Movie/TV Show), Director, Cast, Country, Date Added, Release Year, Rating, Duration, Description.
ii.Categorization: Genres and categories the title is listed in.
Original Dataset Source: While the exact source isn't specified in the notebook, datasets like this are commonly found on platforms like Kaggle.

# Objectives
The primary goals of this project were:
1. Data Loading & Inspection: Load the dataset and understand its structure, data types, and initial quality.
2. Data Cleaning:
a. Handle missing values.
b. Remove duplicate entries.
c. Standardize column names.
d. Correct and transform data formats (e.g., dates, IDs).
e. Ensure data consistency.
3. Data Export: Save the cleaned, analysis-ready data into new files.

# Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries:
1. pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
2. jupyter - For the interactive notebook environment.

# Future Work
This project focused on cleaning. Potential next steps include:
a. Performing a full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends.
b. Creating visualizations to show the distribution of content by country, year, rating, etc
c. Analyzing the most common genres over time.
d. Building a content-based recommendation system.
